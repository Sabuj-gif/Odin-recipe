            <h3><b><i>Follow the Instructions: </i></b></h3>
            <ol>
                <li> In a cup, take 1.5 teaspoons of instant coffee and 1.5 tablespoons sugar (or add as per taste).</li>
                <li> Add 3 tablespoons hot boiling water. You can heat water in an electric kettle or in a small pan. ¼ cup of water can also be added if you prefer a slightly weaker coffee flavor.</li>
                <li> First mix the coffee and sugar with water.</li>
                <li> Then begin to stir briskly and beat coffee for 3 to 4 minutes. You can take a break after 1 to 2 minutes and then continue if your hands start aching. You can also feel free to use a milk frother here if you prefer!</li>
                <li> Beat the coffee till its color lightens and you see a frothy layer on top.</li>
                <li> Then take 1 cup milk in a small but heavy saucepan and boil it on a medium to medium-high heat</li>
                <li> Let the milk come to a brief boil.</li>
                <li> Now pour the milk in a glass jar or a thermos flask.</li>
                <li> Do not use a plastic bottle or jar. Steel is fine. A glass jar with a handle helps while shaking as the milk is hot.</li>
                <li> Now shake the jar vigorously for 1 to 2 minutes.

                     Alternatively, you can also use a handheld frother or blend the milk in a blender.</li>
                <li> Here’s the coffee brew in the cup with the foam still on top.</li>
                <li> Pour the foamy milk in the cup.</li>
                <li> After adding ⅓ or ½ of the milk to the coffee, stir with a spoon. </li>
                <li> Pour in the remaining milk.</li>
                <li> Make sure to add the frothy layer to get the real cafe effect.</li>
                <li> Serve the frothy cafe style hot coffee straightway.</li>
                <li> Feel free to sprinkle some cinnamon powder or cocoa powder on top for a bit of extra yumminess. I hope you enjoy this homemade cafe-style hot coffee as much as I do!</li>
